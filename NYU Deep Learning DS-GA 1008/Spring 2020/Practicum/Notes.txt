Matrix multiplication:
Linear transformations:
	Rotation
	Scaling/Stretching
	Reflection
	Shearing
	Translation
	
Affine Transformations
	
Translation
Scaling - using diagonal matrices

Using matrices and scalars to move things around and zoom

Singular Value Decomposition

Branches of a spiral - example
2D plane
(x, y)
color is a 3rd dimension - defines which class the arms of the spiral belong to

Stretch the space such that all arms become linearly separable
Finally at convergence, we get a matrix with N rows (where N represents the number of classes)
In this case, i/p dimension is 2 (2d space). So number of columns = 2. 5 classes output, so number of rows = 5.

NNs take the space fabric and apply a transformation, which is still parameterized by matrices

Why do we need many matrices and non-linearities?
	Here, we need 2 matrices
	Input matrix = 2
	Intermediate layer = 100
	Non-linearity = positive part
	Output layer = 5
	
Without non-linearities - looks just like a 2 layer network. And 2 layer networks can only do scaling, translation, rotation, reflection and shearing
